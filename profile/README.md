## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Welcome - here you'll find a collection of (hopefully) useful GitHub Actions!

These actions extend GitHub Actions to support testing data-driven workflows.

Setup queues, databases, and other infra, either "for real" or as side-loaded container services, then run your code against them! 

🌈 Contributions welcome via PR!
